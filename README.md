## Dataset

- [CAD files.](https://huggingface.co/datasets/WangHaaa/SourceSearchingDatasetCAD) The 3D models were created by the [RobotAtVirtualHome](https://github.com/DavidFernandezChaves/RobotAtVirtualHome) project and converted into CAD models.
- [CFD data.](https://huggingface.co/datasets/WangHaaa/SourceSearchingDatasetCFD) CFD simulations were conducted using the [OpenFOAM](https://openfoam.org/) 11 software.
- [Dispersion data.](https://huggingface.co/datasets/WangHaaa/source_searching_dataset_step) The diffusion of substances throughout the environment is simulated using [GADEN](https://github.com/MAPIRlab/gaden).
